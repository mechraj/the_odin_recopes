        </h2>
        <p>
            These creamy coconut overnight oats have a great flavor and a boost of protein from Greek yogurt and chia seeds. I topped them with cacao nibs and almonds, but feel free to use fresh fruit or any other topping. Add honey or maple syrup if you like them sweeter.
